    <h1>My Mission</h1>
    <p>
      My mission at ALCHE is to use technology and innovation to create opportunities for young people,
      especially girls who have been denied access to education or forced into early marriage and child labor.
      Through software engineering, I aim to tackle the Global Challenge of Job Creation and embrace the Global
      Opportunity of Youth Empowerment. I am building solutions that open doors to learning, employment,
      and self-reliance turning pain into purpose and purpose into impact.<br/> 
      <br/> 
    The impact of my mission is about changing lives. 
    Through technology and innovation, 
    I empower girls who have been denied 
    education or forced into early marriage and 
    child labor to learn, grow, and take control of their futures.
    They gain skills, confidence, and independence, 
    opening doors to education, careers, and 
    new opportunities. 
    Communities benefit as these girls become role models,
    inspiring others and shifting mindsets toward equality and opportunity.
    Partnering with NGO's to fully bring to life my project called 
    DeRemedy Foundation,
    my mission ensures that vulnerable children receive care, 
    education, and guidance while also gaining practical skills to thrive. 
    Together, we turn barriers into opportunities 
   and challenges into real, lasting impact.
