      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Effiong Immaculata Emmanuel</strong>, and i am passionate about using technology to make a difference.
        I grew up in a community where many girls had limited access to education, and that experience shaped my drive to change lives through knowledge and innovation.
        At ALCHE, I am learning to use software engineering as a tool to empower young people especially girls to dream bigger and create opportunities for themselves and others.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My journey is more than personal growth it is a mission to turn pain into purpose. 
        I believe that every girl deserves the chance to learn, lead, and live free from limitation.
        Through my work, I hope to inspire others to see challenges not as barriers, but as paths to transformation.
